# life-in-code
"Life in Code" is an experiment in Object Oriented Modeling and Domain Driven Design to code real world entities. It is not designed to create an application as much as to explore life from the aspect of a developer. Real life entities are expressed in the terms of properties, Methods and Interactions in order to define how life works in code. 

It is primarily coded in C# and incorporates those basic coding standards and practices. This code is intended to be correct and compilable, and potentially usable as an entity library, though there is no guarantee it will fit into your applicaitons architecture or needed data model.
